## What is Interplanetary Travel Planner?

Interplanetary Travel Planner began as an assignment to build a fully functioning web application with an attractive front end and a database connected to the back end using an ORM to provide users with a functional CRUD application. Inspired by their love of modern space exploration technology, the creators decided to build the travel planning platform of the not-so-distant future, a place where users could get informed about planets to visit and actually book a flight to another planet, aboard the most impressive rockets that represent the pinnacle of human achievement!
