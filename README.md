Time flies differently in the space, so donâ€™t forget to ask someone to check your mailbox now and then.

## What is Interplanetary Travel Planner?

Interplanetary Travel Planner is an amazing web application with an attractive front end and a MySQL database connected to the back end using an ORM to provide users with a functional CRUD application. Inspired by their love of modern space exploration technology, the creators decided to build the travel planning platform of the not-so-distant future, a place where users could get informed about planets to visit and actually book a flight to another planet, aboard the most impressive rockets that represent the pinnacle of human achievement!
